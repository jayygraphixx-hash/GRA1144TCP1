	<h2>Chicken Alfredo </h2>
	<p>Chicken Alfredo is one of those comfort dishes that never really goes out of style. It’s rich, creamy, and filling—perfect for a cozy dinner or when you want something that feels a little indulgent. At its core, it’s pretty simple: tender pieces of chicken served over fettuccine and coated in a smooth Alfredo sauce made from butter, cream, and Parmesan cheese. Even though the ingredients are basic, the flavors come together in a way that feels luxurious.</p>
